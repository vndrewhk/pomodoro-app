Pomodoreact is a Pomodoro*-based focus and work assistance tool built entirely from React, JS, HTML, and CSS. It includes three default timers, an integrated task/to-do list and various colour themes to keep it visually exciting. Tasks persists through sessions to help users start where they left off. 


*Pomodoro is a study and focus strategy that revolves around small sprints of productivity, typically in lengths of 25 minutes each. Named after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Francesco Cirillo used to develop the strategy in the late 1980s. After each "sprint", a short break of 5 minutes is taken, and the work is continued. After 4 short breaks, a long break is taken, typically a length of 20 minutes.
